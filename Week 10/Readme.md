Topology description:
1. R1, R2, R3, R4: Could be cumulus VX or Ubuntu with Frr ( either is fine )
2. Host 1 , 2,3 : Ubuntu with FRR
3. R1, R2, R3 will form BGP with R4

Task 1: EVPN / Vxlan

Create L2 connectivity between host 1, host 2, host 3
Test case: 
Host 1 IP: 10.3.1.1/24
Host 2 IP: 10.3.1.2/24
Host 3 IP: 10.3.1.3/24

All the hosts should be able to ping each other
(Hint / Tip: Hosts will not form BGP with R1, R2, and R3)

Task 2: L3 + GRE Tunnel

Create L3 connectivity between all 3 Hosts, Each host will form BGP with its corresponding router and advertise its own loopback ip
Host 1: 10.10.1.1/32
Host 2: 10.10.1.2/32
Host 3: 10.10.1.3/32

Verify the ping between each hosts

- Setup a GRE tunnel between Host 1 and Host 3
- Set 192.168.100.1/24 on Host 1 tunnel interface
- Set 192.168.100.2/24 on Host 3 Tunnel interface
- Test the ping between 192.168.100.1 and 100.2



Task 3: VRF

All 3 Hosts will form BGP with its corresponding Routers
Host 1 and Host 2 will belong to VRF1
Host 3 will belong to VRF 2

Test case: ( Hosts within the same vrf will be able to ping each other )

Host 1 will be able to ping the loopback IP of Host 2 and vice versa
Host 3 will not be reachable from host 1 and host 2

Move host 2 to VRF 2, and repeat the tests
